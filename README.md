# Magic Eden Airdrop Claim Tool - Solana Version ***UPDATED FOR NEW API***
Create a `.env.local` file with your cookies from mefoundation.com:
   - Go to mefoundation.com and login
   - Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies
   - Copy the values for `cf_clearance` and `session_signature`
   - Add them to a file `.env.local`:
   CF_COOKIE=your_cf_clearance_value
   SESSION_COOKIE=your_session_signature_value

This will authorize you to get past the cloudfare

# Note API
There is no point running this a ton before close to the deadline - After initial testing just run it maybe an hour or two before the claim deadline.I would run it 1 hour before the deadline. In the last 5 mins before claim deadline it sends the requests much faster.You could run it in two tabs to double if you really want to send lots of claims.

## Important Security Notice
As a general security practice, you should never enter private keys into websites. This tool should only be used as a last resort for compromised wallets to attempt claiming allocations before unauthorized parties do.

## Features
- Automated claim scheduling with configurable intervals
- Real-time deadline countdown and status monitoring
- Multiple wallet pair support for batch operations
- Secure signature generation using TweetNaCl
- Responsive UI with dark mode
- Secure claim wallet configuration

## How It Works
1. Configure your secure claim wallet that will receive the allocations
2. Add one or more compromised wallet pairs (private key + public address)
3. The tool will automatically attempt claims based on the schedule
4. All claims from compromised wallets will be directed to your secure claim wallet
5. Monitor success rates and status in real-time
